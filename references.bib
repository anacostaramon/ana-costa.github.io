abstract = {Cancer drugs have accumulated the most approvals over the past years. Overall survival (OS) is considered the gold standard for cancer trial outcomes. However, its use has declined over the past years, in favor of surrogate endpoints, such as progression-free survival (PFS). PFS allows to assess outcomes earlier and, thus, accelerates approval of cancer drugs. Previous studies have demonstrated a poor correlation between PFS and OS. Using simulation models, we examined why PFS usually overestimates survival benefit. We created a publicly accessible web application that allows users to run the simulations with different parameter settings. Based on the findings, we propose that assessment of preliminary evidence should be based on a combination of OS result and prognostic scores that reflect the health status of surviving patients.}

Cirrhosis is more prevalent than colorectal cancer and has a comparable age-standardized mortality rate to lung cancer. Despite this fact, there are no screening programmes in place for early detection of liver fibrosis, the precursor of cirrhosis. In this Perspective, we use insights from colorectal and lung cancer screening to explore the benefits, challenges, implementation strategies and pathways for future liver fibrosis screening initiatives. Several non-invasive methods and referral pathways for early identification of liver fibrosis exist, but in addition to accurate detection, screening programmes must also be cost-effective and demonstrate benefit through a reduction in liver-related mortality. Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm this. Future randomized screening trials should evaluate not only the screening tests, but also interventions used to halt disease progression in individuals identified through screening.},

However, evidence on the real-world causal effects of switching patients from VKA to DOAC is lacking. We aimed to assess the empirical incremental cost-effectiveness of switching patients to DOAC compared with maintaining VKA treatment.Methods The target trial approach was applied to the prospective observational Swiss-AF cohort, which enrolled 2415 AF patients from 2014 to 2017. Clinical data, healthcare resource utilisation and EQ-5D-based utilities representing quality of life were collected in yearly follow-ups. Health insurance claims were available for 1024 patients (42.4%). Overall survival, quality-of-life, costs from the Swiss statutory health insurance perspective and cost-effectiveness were estimated by emulating a target trial in which patients were randomly assigned to switch to DOAC or maintain VKA treatment.Results 228 patients switching from VKA to DOAC compared with 563 patients maintaining VKA treatment had no overall survival advantage over a 5-year observation period (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.45, 1.55). The estimated gain in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) was 0.003 over the 5-year period at an incremental costs of CHF 23 033 (€ 20 940). The estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was CHF 425 852 (€ 387 138) per QALY gained.Conclusions Applying a causal inference method to real-world data, we could not demonstrate switching to DOACs to be cost-effective for AF patients with at least 1 year of VKA treatment.

	abstract = {Background Patients with decompensated cirrhosis experience high mortality rates. Current prognostic scores, including the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD), may underperform in settings other than in those they were initially developed. Novel biomarkers have been proposed to improve prognostication accuracy and even to predict development of complications.Methods We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on novel urine and blood biomarkers and their ability to predict 90-day mortality in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Secondary outcomes included 28-day and 1-year mortality, and development of acute-on-chronic liver failure, acute kidney injury and other complications. To overcome differences in units, temporal changes in assays and reporting heterogeneity, we used the ratio of means (RoM) as measure of association for assessing strength in predicting outcomes. An RoM\&gt;1 implies that the mean biomarker level is higher in those that develop the outcome than in those that do not.Results Of 6629 unique references, 103 were included, reporting on 29 different biomarkers, with a total of 31 362 biomarker patients. Most studies were prospective cohorts of hospitalised patients (median Child-Pugh-Turcotte score of 9 and MELD score of 18). The pooled 90-day mortality rate was 0.27 (95\% CI 0.24 to 0.29). The RoM for predicting 90-day mortality was highest for interleukin 6 (IL-6) (2.56, 95\% CI 2.39 to 2.74), followed by urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (uNGAL) (2.42, 95\% CI 2.20 to 2.66) and copeptin (2.33, 95\% CI 2.17 to 2.50). These RoMs were all higher than for MELD (1.44, 95\% CI 1.42 to 1.46).Conclusion Novel biomarkers, including IL-6, uNGAL and copeptin, can probably improve prognostication of patients with decompensated cirrhosis compared with MELD alone.All data relevant to the study are included in the article or uploaded as online supplemental information.

abstract = {Objectives
Randomized controlled trials of pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) for treating atrial fibrillation (AF) have proven the procedure’s efficacy. Studies assessing its empirical cost-effectiveness outside randomized trial settings are lacking. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of PVI versus medical therapy for AF.
Methods
We followed a target trial approach using the Swiss-AF cohort, a prospective observational cohort study that enrolled patients with AF between 2014 and 2017. Resource utilization and cost information were collected through claims data. Quality of life was measured with EQ-5D-3L utilities. We estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) from the perspective of the Swiss statutory health insurance system.
Results
Patients undergoing PVI compared with medical therapy had a 5-year overall survival advantage with a hazard ratio of 0.75 (95% CI 0.46-1.21; P = .69) and a 19.8% SD improvement in quality of life (95% CI 15.5-22.9; P < .001), at an incremental cost of 29 604 Swiss francs (CHF) (95% CI 16 354-42 855; P < .001). The estimated ICER was CHF 158 612 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained within a 5-year time horizon. Assuming similar health effects and costs over 5 additional years changed the ICER to CHF 82 195 per QALY gained. Results were robust to the sensitivity analyses performed.
Conclusions
Our results show that PVI might be a cost-effective intervention within the Swiss healthcare context in a 10-year time horizon, but unlikely to be so at 5 years, if a willingness-to-pay threshold of CHF 100 000 per QALY gained is assumed. Given data availability, we find target trial designs are a valuable tool for assessing the cost-effectiveness of healthcare interventions outside of randomized controlled trial settings.}

The objective of this research was to assess regulatory review duration of first and supplementary indications approved between 2011 and 2020 in the United States and Europe (European Union [EU] and Switzerland) and differences in submission times between the United States and Europe. Descriptive statistics were applied to review times between the jurisdictions and across the therapeutic areas. A regression analysis was done to estimate the association between approval agency and review times. The primary analysis cohort included 241 drugs approved in the United States, the EU, and Switzerland. Of these, 128 drugs had supplemental indications (331 in total) in the United States and 87 had supplemental indications (206 in total) in the EU. Overall median review duration from submission to approval subtracting the clock stop period was 39 weeks in the United States, 44 weeks in the EU, and 44 weeks in Switzerland. When review times within each drug were compared, the European Medicines Agency took a median of 3.7 weeks (IQR, ?6.7 to 14.9 weeks) longer than the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Swissmedic a median of 0.3 weeks (IQR, ?10.6 to 15.3 weeks) longer. Median total review duration for supplemental indications was 26 weeks in the United States and 40 weeks in the EU. Applications were submitted a median of 1.3 and 17.9 weeks later in the EU and Switzerland, respectively, than in the United States. The regression analysis showed small differences in submission times between the United States and the EU (?2.1 weeks [95% CI, ?11.7 to 7.6 weeks]) and larger differences between the United States and Switzerland (33.0 weeks [CI, 23.1 to 42.8 weeks]). It would be beneficial for patients if differences in submission times between the United States and Europe continue to be minimized.},

Among the 710,800 registered clinical trials in this time period, 2669 clinical trials for AI/ML-enabled medical devices were identified and included in our study cohort. Of these, 2517 clinical trials provided information on the locations where the trial was conducted. Most of the trials were conducted for the medical specialties of radiology, general hospital, gastroenterology, and urology. Almost all were national trials; 1095 were conducted in China, followed by the United States (196), Japan (162), India (139), and Korea (118). The countries with the most enrolled patients in clinical trials per 100,000 inhabitants were mainly smaller countries in Asia and Europe.

	abstract = {Aims Atrial fibrillation (AF) costs are expected to be substantial, but cost comparisons with the general population are scarce. Using data from the prospective Swiss-AF cohort study and population-based controls, we estimated the impact of AF on direct healthcare costs from the Swiss statutory health insurance perspective.Methods Swiss-AF patients, enrolled from 2014 to 2017, had documented, prevalent AF. We analysed 5 years of follow-up, where clinical data, and health insurance claims in 42\% of the patients were collected on a yearly basis. Controls from a health insurance claims database were matched for demographics and region. The cost impact of AF was estimated using five different methods: (1) ordinary least square regression (OLS), (2) OLS-based two-part modelling, (3) generalised linear model-based two-part modelling, (4) 1:1 nearest neighbour propensity score matching and (5) a cost adjudication algorithm using Swiss-AF data non-comparatively and considering clinical data. Cost of illness at the Swiss national level was modelled using obtained cost estimates, prevalence from the Global Burden of Disease Project, and Swiss population data.Results The 1024 Swiss-AF patients with available claims data were compared with 16 556 controls without known AF. AF patients accrued CHF5600 (EUR5091) of AF-related direct healthcare costs per year, in addition to non-AF-related healthcare costs of CHF11100 (EUR10 091) per year accrued by AF patients and controls. All five methods yielded comparable results. AF-related costs at the national level were estimated to amount to 1\% of Swiss healthcare expenditure.Conclusions We robustly found direct medical costs of AF patients were 50\% higher than those of population-based controls.

Therapeutic ratings were available for 107 (86\%) first and 179 (53\%) supplemental indications in the US and for 87 (99\%) first and 184 (86\%) supplemental indications in Europe. Among FDA approved indications with available ratings, 41\% (44/107) had high therapeutic value ratings for first indications compared with 34\% (61/179) for supplemental indications. In Europe, 47\% (41/87) of first and 36\% (67/184) of supplemental indications had high therapeutic value ratings. Among FDA approvals, when the sample was restricted to the first three approved indications, second indication approvals were 36\% less likely to have a high value rating (relative ratio 0.64, 95\% confidence interval 0.43 to 0.96) and third indication approvals were 45\% less likely (0.55, 0.29 to 1.01) compared with the first indication approval. Similar findings were observed for Europe and when weighting by the inverse number of indications for each drug.Conclusions The proportion of supplemental indications rated as having high therapeutic value was substantially lower than for first indications.

As part of the Swiss-AF prospective cohort study, we aimed to characterise AF costs and their development over time, and to assess specific patient clusters and their cost trajectories.Methods Swiss-AF enrolled 2415 patients with variable duration of AF between 2014 and 2017. Patient clusters were identified using hierarchical cluster analysis of baseline characteristics. Ongoing yearly follow-ups include health insurance clinical and claims data. An algorithm was developed to adjudicate costs to AF and related complications.Results A subpopulation of 1024 Swiss-AF patients with available claims data was followed up for a median (IQR) of 3.24 (1.09) years. Average yearly AF-adjudicated costs amounted to SFr5679 ({\texteuro}5163), remaining stable across the observation period. AF-adjudicated costs consisted mainly of inpatient and outpatient AF treatment costs (SFr4078; {\texteuro}3707), followed by costs of bleeding (SFr696; {\texteuro}633) and heart failure (SFr494; {\texteuro}449). Hierarchical analysis identified three patient clusters: cardiovascular (CV; N=253 with claims), isolated-symptomatic (IS; N=586) and severely morbid without cardiovascular disease (SM; N=185). The CV cluster and SM cluster depicted similarly high costs across all cost outcomes; IS patients accrued the lowest costs.Conclusion Our results highlight three well-defined patient clusters with specific costs that could be used for stratification in both clinical and economic studies.

	abstract = {Introduction Many countries have implemented indoor smoking bans over the past two decades. Although smoking bans have been shown to reduce cardiovascular outcomes, little is known about their impact on respiratory health. This study investigated the impact of a nationwide indoor smoking ban on smoking behaviour and lung function.Methods We used repeated cross-sectional data from two large cohorts of the general population comprising 31 807 Swiss and 62 093 Danish adults. We compared associations between smoking ban and smoking prevalence and prebronchodilator lung function trends in Denmark (indoor smoking ban introduced in 2007) and Switzerland (indoor smoking ban introduced in 2010) from 2005 to 2010 using a quasi-experimental study design. We performed difference-in-difference analyses with linear regression models adjusted for age, sex, weight and height.Results Denmark had a stronger decrease in active smokers compared with Switzerland. Also, forced expiratory volume in the first second was higher in Danish adults than in Swiss adults: 26 mL (95\% CI 2.4 to 49) 1 year, 88 mL (65 to 112) 2 years, and 74 mL (51 to 98) 3 years after smoking ban implementation. Correspondingly, forced vital capacity was higher in Danish adults compared with Swiss adults (80 mL (50 to 109) after 1 year and 126 mL (97 to 155) after two and 3 years). Improvements were observed in both never-smokers and ever-smokers, most pronounced in ever-smokers.Conclusions Nationwide indoor smoking ban is associated with less smoking and improved lung function in the general population. Implementing an indoor smoking ban can improve lung function by influencing smoking behaviour and reducing secondhand smoke.The Swiss data are available from the corresponding author MAP (miloalan.puhan@uzh.ch) upon reasonable request.

    abstract = {Biologics account for a substantial proportion of health care expenditures. Their costs have been projected to reach US \$452 billion in global spending by 2022. Given recent expiration of patent protection of biologics, a shift toward greater follow-on competition among biosimilars would be expected that would allow greater uptake and lower drug costs.To assess uptake and prices of biosimilars in the US compared with 2 European countries (Germany and Switzerland) with national mechanisms for drug price negotiation.In this cohort study, biologics and biosimilars that were approved in the US, Germany, and Switzerland until August 2020 were identified. Prices and sales data were extracted from public and commercial databases for the years 2011 to 2020. Data were analyzed from August 1, 2021, to February 28, 2022.Descriptive statistics were used to show temporal trends in the uptake of biosimilars and relative prices compared with those of reference products (ie, biologic agents) for each country. Descriptive analysis was also performed to compare the uptake of biosimilars between the 3 countries limited to biologics that have biosimilars on the market in all countries. To test if biosimilar awareness in each country increased over the last decade, a linear least squares regression was applied.The study cohort included 15 biosimilars and 6 biologics for the US, 52 biosimilars and 15 biologics for Germany, and 28 biosimilars and 13 biologics for Switzerland. Uptake of biosimilars increased over time in all countries. On average, the biosimilar market share at launch was highest in Germany; however, it increased at the fastest rate in the US. Monthly treatment costs of biosimilars in the US were a median of 1.94 (IQR, 1.78-2.44) and 2.74 (IQR, 1.91-3.46) higher than corresponding costs in Germany and Switzerland, respectively.The findings of this cohort study suggest that more biosimilars have been marketed in Germany and Switzerland than in the US. Policies that counter anticompetitive practices in the US could allow biosimilars to enter the market sooner and could also lower health care costs with improved access. Awareness of biosimilars should be promoted to increase uptake of biosimilars globally.},

   abstract = {The natural history of compensated cirrhosis due to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has not been completely characterized. The aim of the present study was to assess the incidence and risk factors of acute decompensation of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and extrahepatic cancers. This was a multicenter, retrospective, cohort study including 449 patients with compensated cirrhosis due to NAFLD. We calculated cumulative incidences and used competitive risk analysis to determine the risk factors associated with decompensation and cancer development. Over a median of 39 months of follow-up, 124 patients (28%) presented acute decompensation. The most frequent decompensation was ascites (21%) followed by hepatic encephalopathy (15%), variceal bleeding (9%), and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (3%). Acute-on-chronic liver failure was diagnosed in 6% of patients during follow-up. Liver function parameters and specifically an albumin level below 40 g/L were independently associated with an increased risk of decompensation. The presence of ischemic heart disease was independently associated with acute decompensation. Seventy-eight patients (18%) developed hepatocellular carcinoma or extrahepatic cancers during follow-up (51 and 27, respectively). Conclusion: Patients with compensated cirrhosis due to NAFLD are at high risk of severe liver complications, such as the development of acute decompensation, in a relative short follow-up time. This population is at high risk of hepatic and extrahepatic cancers.},

abstract = {Background & Aims
Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) and the nonalcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis score (NFS) are the 2 most popular noninvasive blood-based serum tests proposed for widespread fibrosis screening. We therefore aimed to describe the accuracy of FIB-4 and NFS to detect elevated liver stiffness as an indicator of hepatic fibrosis in low-prevalence populations.
Methods
This study included a total of 5129 patients with concomitant measurement of FIB-4, NFS, and liver stiffness measurement (LSM) by Fibroscan (Echosens, France) from 5 independent population-based cohorts from Spain, Hong Kong, Denmark, England, and France; 3979 participants from the general population and 1150 from at-risk cohorts due to alcohol, diabetes, or obesity. We correlated LSM with FIB-4 and NFS, and calculated pre- and post-test predictive values of FIB-4 and NFS to detect elevated LSM at 8 kPa and 12 kPa cutoffs. The mean age was 53 ± 12 years, the mean body mass index was 27 ± 5 kg/m2, and 2439 (57%) were women. One in 10 patients (552; 11%) had liver stiffness ≥8 kPa, but 239 of those (43%) had a normal FIB-4, and 171 (31%) had normal NFS. The proportion of false-negatives was higher in at-risk patients than the general population. FIB-4 was false-negative in 11% of diabetic subjects, compared with 2.5% false-negatives with NFS. Waist circumference outperformed FIB-4 and NFS for detecting LSM ≥8 kPa in the general population. Almost one-third (28%–29%) of elevated FIB-4/NFS were false-positive in both the general population and at-risk cohorts.
Conclusions
FIB-4 and NFS are suboptimal for screening purposes due to a high risk of overdiagnosis and a non-negligible percentage of false-negatives, especially in patients with risk factors for chronic liver disease. Waist circumference emerged as a potential first step to identify patients at risk for liver fibrosis in the general population.}

abstract = {Background & Aims
Portal hypertension is the strongest predictor of hepatic decompensation and death in patients with cirrhosis. However, its discriminatory accuracy in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been challenged because hepatic vein catheterization may not reflect the real portal vein pressure as accurately as in patients with other etiologies. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) and presence of portal hypertension–related decompensation in patients with advanced NAFLD (aNAFLD).
Methods
Multicenter cross-sectional study included 548 patients with aNAFLD and 444 with advanced RNA-positive hepatitis C (aHCV) who had detailed portal hypertension evaluation (HVPG measurement, gastroscopy, and abdominal imaging). We examined the relationship between etiology, HVPG, and decompensation by logistic regression models. We also compared the proportions of compensated/decompensated patients at different HVPG levels.
Results
Both cohorts, aNAFLD and aHVC, had similar baseline age, gender, Child-Pugh score, and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score. Median HVPG was lower in the aNAFLD cohort (13 vs 15 mmHg) despite similar liver function and higher rates of decompensation in aNAFLD group (32% vs 25%; P = .019) than in the aHCV group. For any of the HVPG cutoff analyzed (<10, 10–12, or 12 mmHg) the prevalence of decompensation was higher in the aNAFLD group than in the aHCV group.
Conclusions
Patients with aNAFLD have higher prevalence of portal hypertension–related decompensation at any value of HVPG as compared with aHCV patients. Longitudinal studies aiming to identify HVPG thresholds able to predict decompensation and long-term outcomes in aNAFLD population are strongly needed.}

   abstract = {There are major shortfalls in the identification and screening of at-risk migrant groups. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a new digital tool (IS-MiHealth) integrated into the electronic patient record system of primary care centres in detecting prevalent migrant infections. IS-MiHealth provides targeted recommendations to health professionals for screening multiple infections, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B and C, active tuberculosis (TB), Chagas disease, strongyloidiasis and schistosomiasis, based on patient characteristics (including variables of country of origin, age and sex).A pragmatic pilot cluster-randomized-controlled trial was deployed from March to December 2018. Eight primary care centres in Catalonia, Spain, were randomly allocated 1:1 to use of the digital tool for screening, or to routine care. The primary outcome was the monthly diagnostic yield of all aggregated infections. Intervention and control sites were compared before and after implementation with respect to their monthly diagnostic yield using regression models. This study is registered on international standard randomised controlled trial number (ISRCTN) (ISRCTN14795012).A total of 15 780 migrants registered across the eight centres had at least one visit during the intervention period (March–December 2018), of which 14 598 (92.51%) fulfilled the criteria to be screened for at least one infection. There were 210 (2.57%) individuals from the intervention group with new diagnoses compared with 113 (1.49%) from the control group [odds ratio: 2.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.63–2.64, P < 0.001]. The intervention centres raised their overall monthly diagnosis rate to 5.80 (95% CI 1.23–10.38, P = 0.013) extra diagnoses compared with the control centres. This monthly increase in diagnosis in intervention centres was also observed if we consider all cases together of HIV, hepatitis B and C, and active TB cases [2.72 (95% CI 0.43–5.00); P = 0.02] and was observed as well for the parasitic infections’ group (Chagas disease, strongyloidiasis and schistosomiasis) 2.58 (95% CI 1.60–3.57; P < 0.001).The IS-MiHealth increased screening rate and diagnostic yield for key infections in migrants in a population-based primary care setting. Further testing and development of this new tool is warranted in larger trials and in other countries.},

abstract = {Background
Most patients with COPD do not maintain exercise training after pulmonary rehabilitation (PR).
Research Question
Does a 12-month home-based, minimal-equipment strength training program after PR have an effect on dyspnea, exercise capacity, and patient-reported outcomes in patients with COPD?
Study Design and Methods
In a parallel-arm multicenter study across four Swiss PR clinics, patients with COPD were allocated randomly (1:1 ratio) into an intervention group (IG; home-based strength training program) or control group (CG; usual care). The primary outcome was change in Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ) dyspnea scale score from baseline to 12 months. Secondary outcomes were change in exercise capacity (1-min sit-to-stand-test [1MSTST], 6-min walk test [6MWT]), health-related quality of life, exacerbations, and symptoms. We assessed the IG’s experience by interviews at study end. Main analyses were based on the intention-to-treat approach, and adjusted linear regression models were used.
Results
One hundred twenty-three patients with COPD (IG, n = 61; CG, n = 62) were randomized, 61 of whom were women and whose mean ± SD age was 66.8 ± 8.1 years and mean ± SD FEV1 was 39.3 ± 15.3% predicted. One hundred four participants completed 12 months of follow-up (IG, n= 53; CG, n= 51). Of the 53 IG participants, 37 participants (70%) conducted the training until study end. We found no difference in change in CRQ dyspnea scale score over 12 months (adjusted mean difference, 0.28; 95% CI, –0.23 to 0.80; P = .27). We found moderate evidence for a difference in 1MSTST repetitions favoring the IG (adjusted mean difference, 2.6; 95% CI, 0.22-5.03; P = .033), but no evidence for an effect in other outcomes. Seventy-nine percent of the IG reported positive effects that they attributed to the training.
Interpretation
The home exercise program had no effect on dyspnea, but improved 1MSTST performance and patient-perceived fitness. The supported program was well accepted by patients with COPD and may facilitate continued exercise training at home.

   abstract = {Background & Aims
Colonoscopy reduces colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality in Lynch syndrome (LS) carriers. However, a high incidence of postcolonoscopy CRC (PCCRC) has been reported. Colonoscopy is highly dependent on endoscopist skill and is subject to quality variability. We aimed to evaluate the impact of key colonoscopy quality indicators on adenoma detection and prevention of PCCRC in LS.
Methods
We conducted a multicenter study focused on LS carriers without previous CRC undergoing colonoscopy surveillance (n = 893). Incident colorectal neoplasia during surveillance and quality indicators of all colonoscopies were analyzed. We performed an emulated target trial comparing the results from the first and second surveillance colonoscopies to assess the effect of colonoscopy quality indicators on adenoma detection and PCCRC incidence. Risk analyses were conducted using a multivariable logistic regression model.
Results
The 10-year cumulative incidence of adenoma and PCCRC was 60.6% (95% CI, 55.5%–65.2%) and 7.9% (95% CI, 5.2%–10.6%), respectively. Adequate bowel preparation (odds ratio [OR], 2.07; 95% CI, 1.06–4.3), complete colonoscopies (20% vs 0%; P = .01), and pan-chromoendoscopy use (OR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.15–3.95) were associated with significant improvement in adenoma detection. PCCRC risk was significantly lower when colonoscopies were performed during a time interval of less than every 3 years (OR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.14–0.97). We observed a consistent but not significant reduction in PCCRC risk for a previous complete examination (OR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.03–1.28), adequate bowel preparation (OR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.17–3.24), or previous use of high-definition colonoscopy (OR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.02–2.33).
Conclusions
Complete colonoscopies with adequate bowel preparation and chromoendoscopy use are associated with improved adenoma detection, while surveillance intervals of less than 3 years are associated with a reduction of PCCRC incidence. In LS, high-quality colonoscopy surveillance is of utmost importance for CRC prevention.},

   abstract = {Study Design. 

A post hoc analysis.

Objective. 

Advances in machine learning (ML) have led to tools offering individualized outcome predictions for adult spinal deformity (ASD). Our objective is to examine the properties of these ASD models in a cohort of adult symptomatic lumbar scoliosis (ASLS) patients.

Summary of Background Data. 

ML algorithms produce patient-specific probabilities of outcomes, including major complication (MC), reoperation (RO), and readmission (RA) in ASD. External validation of these models is needed.

Methods. 

Thirty-nine predictive factors (12 demographic, 9 radiographic, 4 health-related quality of life, 14 surgical) were retrieved and entered into web-based prediction models for MC, unplanned RO, and hospital RA. Calculated probabilities were compared with actual event rates. Discrimination and calibration were analyzed using receiver operative characteristic area under the curve (where 0.5=chance, 1=perfect) and calibration curves (Brier scores, where 0.25=chance, 0=perfect). Ninety-five percent confidence intervals are reported.

Results. 

A total of 169 of 187 (90%) surgical patients completed 2-year follow up. The observed rate of MCs was 41.4% with model predictions ranging from 13% to 68% (mean: 38.7%). RO was 20.7% with model predictions ranging from 9% to 54% (mean: 30.1%). Hospital RA was 17.2% with model predictions ranging from 13% to 50% (mean: 28.5%). Model classification for all three outcome measures was better than chance for all [area under the curve=MC 0.6 (0.5–0.7), RA 0.6 (0.5–0.7), RO 0.6 (0.5–0.7)]. Calibration was better than chance for all, though best for RA and RO (Brier Score=MC 0.22, RA 0.16, RO 0.17).

Conclusions. 

ASD prediction models for MC, RA, and RO performed better than chance in a cohort of adult lumbar scoliosis patients, though the homogeneity of ASLS affected calibration and accuracy. Optimization of models require samples with the breadth of outcomes (0%–100%), supporting the need for continued data collection as personalized prediction models may improve decision-making for the patient and surgeon alike.},

   abstract = {Cirrhosis, highly prevalent worldwide, develops after years of hepatic inflammation triggering progressive fibrosis. Currently, the main etiologies of cirrhosis are non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and alcohol-related liver disease, although chronic hepatitis B and C infections are still major etiological factors in some areas of the world. Recent studies have shown that liver fibrosis can be assessed with relatively high accuracy noninvasively by serological tests, transient elastography, and radiological methods. These modalities may be utilized for screening for liver fibrosis in at-risk populations. Thus far, a limited number of population-based studies using noninvasive tests in different areas of the world indicate that a significant percentage of subjects without known liver disease (around 5% in general populations and a higher rate −18% to 27%-in populations with risk factors for liver disease) have significant undetected liver fibrosis or established cirrhosis. Larger international studies are required to show the harms and benefits before concluding that screening for liver fibrosis should be applied to populations at risk for chronic liver diseases. Screening for liver fibrosis has the potential for changing the current approach from diagnosing chronic liver diseases late when patients have already developed complications of cirrhosis to diagnosing liver fibrosis in asymptomatic subjects providing the opportunity of preventing disease progression.},

abstract = {Increases in medication cost-sharing rates remain a controversial system-wide cost-containment measure for chronic mental health patients. The objective was to investigate the effects of cost-sharing increases on adherence to prescribed antipsychotic medication and psychiatric hospitalizations among patients with schizophrenia. In July 2012, a Spanish National Law raised the cost-sharing rate from 0 to 10\% for pensioner outpatient medication while cost-sharing remained at 0\% for other socioeconomic groups. To estimate the effects of the reform, we analyzed the prevalent adult schizophrenic population of Valencia, Spain, followed up 1 year before and after the Law took effect. We used a quasi-experimental design with a patient fixed-effects difference-in-differences regression to evaluate the reform effects on antipsychotic medication adherence, prescription, and hospitalization rates. A total of 5,672 included patients were exposed to the reform, whereas 5,545 were not. There were no differences in adherence, prescription, or hospitalization rates between exposed and nonexposed patients prior to its implementation. The odds ratio of exposed patients remaining adherent to issued prescriptions after the reform took effect were 0.70 99\% confidence interval (CI 0.66–0.75), in relation to the nonexposed group. Additionally, the reform was associated with a reduction in exposure to antipsychotic medication (odds ratio (OR) 0.85, 99\%CI 0.83–0.88) and an increase in hospitalization risk (OR 1.13, 99\% CI 1.05–1.23) during the first year after implementation. Policies raising the cost-sharing rate of medication for patients with schizophrenia are simultaneously associated with unintended effects. We report decreases in antipsychotic exposure and increases in hospitalization rates that lasted for 1 year after follow-up.},

We examined real-world effects of cantonal legislations to direct surgery patients from the inpatient to the outpatient setting in Switzerland.
Methods
Analyses were based on claims data of the Helsana Group, a leading Swiss health insurance. The study population consisted of 13’145 (in 2014), 12’455 (in 2016), and 12’875 (in 2018) insured persons aged >18 years who had haemorrhoidectomy, inguinal hernia repair, varicose vein surgery, knee arthroscopy/meniscectomy or surgery of the cervix/uterus. We assessed the proportion of inpatient procedures, index costs, length of hospital stays, outpatient costs and hospitalizations during follow-up, stratified by procedure, in-/outpatient setting, and the presence (enacted/effective in 2018) of a cantonal legislation. We used difference-in-differences methods to study the impact of cantonal legislations.
Results
Overall, the proportion of procedures performed in the inpatient setting decreased between 2014 and 2018 (p < 0.001). The decrease between 2016 and 2018 was significantly steeper in cantons with a legislation (p < 0.001; effect size: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.51, 0.64), leading to steeper decreases in healthcare costs of index procedures in cantons with a legislation, with no impact on length of hospital stays. The legislation also had no impact on outpatient costs or hospitalizations during follow-up.
Conclusions
The cantonal legislations achieved the intended effects of inpatient surgery substitution by outpatient surgery, with no evidence suggesting negative effects on costs or hospitalizations during follow-up.}

   abstract = {Adult spinal deformity (ASD) is a complex and heterogeneous disease that can severely impact patients’ lives. While it is clear that surgical correction can achieve significant improvement of spinopelvic parameters and quality of life measures in adults with spinal deformity, there remains a high risk of complication associated with surgical approaches to adult deformity. Over the past decade, utilization of surgical correction for ASD has increased dramatically as deformity correction techniques have become more refined and widely adopted. Along with this increase in surgical utilization, there has been a massive undertaking by spine surgeons to develop more robust models to predict postoperative outcomes in an effort to mitigate the relatively high complication rates. A large part of this revolution within spine surgery has been the gradual adoption of predictive analytics harnessing artificial intelligence through the use of machine learning algorithms. The development of predictive models to accurately prognosticate patient outcomes following ASD surgery represents a dramatic improvement over prior statistical models which are better suited for finding associations between variables than for their predictive utility. Machine learning models, which offer the ability to make more accurate and reproducible predictions, provide surgeons with a wide array of practical applications from augmenting clinical decision making to more wide-spread public health implications. The inclusion of these advanced computational techniques in spine practices will be paramount for improving the care of patients, by empowering both patients and surgeons to more specifically tailor clinical decisions to address individual health profiles and needs.},

Generosity is defined as giving a candidate the lowest possible grade required to progress in the hiring process. Analyzing a high-stake hiring process, we find that for each candidate graded generously, the probability for subsequent candidates to pass decreased by 7.7\% (experiment 1; N = 11,281). Testing the boundary conditions of the generosity-effect, we explore a hiring process that, in contrast to the previous process, was very selective, because candidates were more likely to fail than to pass. In this scenario, no evidence is found for the generosity-erosion effect (experiment 2; N = 3171). Practical implications and mechanisms underlying the generosity-erosion effect are further discussed.}}

abstract = {Background & Aims
An algorithm based on fecal levels of 2 microRNAs (miR-421 and miR-27a-3p), fecal hemoglobin concentration, and patient age and sex can identify patients with advanced colorectal neoplasia. We investigated whether this algorithm, called miRFec, could increase effectiveness and efficiency of fecal immunochemical test (FIT)-based colorectal cancer (CRC) screening programs.
Methods
We obtained data and fecal samples from 767 persons with a positive result from the FIT who then underwent colonoscopy examination while participating a population-based CRC screening program, from March 2011 through May 2017 in Barcelona, Spain. Fecal miRNAs were isolated from the buffer contained in the original FIT collection device and analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription PCR. Aims were to evaluate the usefulness of the miRFec algorithm in identifying persons at greatest risk for CRC who should be prioritized for colonoscopy examination and individuals at low risk for whom colonoscopy could be avoided.
Results
Of the 767 study subjects, 414 (54.0%) were found by colonoscopy to have advanced colorectal neoplasia (67 with CRC and 347 with advanced adenomas) and 353 (46.0%) were found to have either non-advanced adenomas (n = 136) or a normal examination (n = 217). MiRFec algorithm scores (1–4) were independently associated with the presence of advanced colorectal neoplasia (P < .001). The miRFec algorithm differentiated patients with CRC from those with non-advanced adenomas or normal colonoscopy with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 90% (95% CI, 86–94). Subjects with miRFec scores in the 4th quartile (above 3.09, high-risk group) were 8-fold more likely to have advanced colorectal neoplasia than subjects with miRFec scores in the 1st quartile (below 2.14, low-risk group). Subjects in the low-risk group had a positive predictive value below 30% for detection of advanced colorectal neoplasia. When we used a 50% specificity cut-off value, the miRFec algorithm identified 97% of patients with CRC and would allow 264 subjects (34.4%) to avoid colonoscopy examination.
Conclusions
An algorithm based on fecal levels of 2 miRNAs and hemoglobin, patient age and sex (miRFec) differentiated patients with CRC from those with non-advanced adenomas or normal colonoscopy with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve value of 90% and avoided 34% of colonoscopies. Inclusion of this algorithm in FIT-based CRC screening programs could increase their effectiveness and efficiency.}

   abstract = {Background:Intensive care unit (ICU)–acquired infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria have been associated with substantial health and economic costs. Moreover, southern Europe has historically reported high levels of antimicrobial resistance.Objectives:We estimated the attributable economic burden of ICU-acquired infections due to resistant bacteria based upon hospital excess length of stay (LOS) in a selected sample of southern European countries.Methods:We studied a cohort of adult patients admitted to the ICU who developed an ICU-acquired infection related to an invasive procedure in a sample of Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese hospitals between 2008 and 2016, using data from The European Surveillance System (TESSy) released by the European Centers for Disease Control (ECDC). We analyzed the association between infections with selected antibiotic-resistant bacteria of public health importance and excess LOS using regression, matching, and time-to-event methods. We controlled for several confounding factors as well as time-dependent biases. We also computed the associated economic burden of excess resource utilization for each selected country.Results:In total, 13,441 patients with at least 1 ICU-acquired infection were included in the analysis: 4,106 patients (30.5%) were infected with antimicrobial-resistant bacteria, whereas 9,335 patients (69.5%) were infected with susceptible bacteria. The unadjusted association between resistance status and excess LOS was 7 days (95% CI, 6.13–7.87; P < .001). Fully adjusted models yielded significantly lower estimates: 2.76 days (95% CI, 1.98–3.54; P < .001) in the regression model, 2.60 days (95% CI, 1.66–3.55; P < .001) in the genetic matching model, and a hazard ratio of 1.15 (95% CI, 1.11–1.19; P < .001) in the adjusted Cox regression model. These estimates, alongside the prevalence of resistance, translated into direct hospitalization attributable costs per ICU-acquired infection of 5,224€ (95% CI, 3,691–6,757) for Spain, 4,461€ (95% CI, 1,948–6,974) for Portugal, and 4,320€ (95% CI, 1,662–6,977) for Italy.Conclusions:ICU-acquired infections associated with antibiotic-resistant bacteria are substantially associated with a 15% increase in excess LOS and resource utilization in 3 southern European countries. However, failure to appropriately control for significant confounders inflates estimates by ∼2.5-fold.},

Management of decompensated cirrhosis is currently geared towards the treatment of complications once they occur. To date there is no established disease-modifying therapy aimed at halting progression of the disease and preventing the development of complications in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. The design of clinical trials to investigate new therapies for patients with decompensated cirrhosis is complex. The population of patients with decompensated cirrhosis is heterogeneous (i.e., different etiologies, comorbidities and disease severity), leading to the inclusion of diverse populations in clinical trials. In addition, primary endpoints selected for trials that include patients with decompensated cirrhosis are not homogeneous and at times may not be appropriate. This leads to difficulties in comparing results obtained from different trials. Against this background, the LiverHope Consortium organized a meeting of experts, the goal of which was to develop recommendations for the design of clinical trials and to define appropriate endpoints, both for trials aimed at modifying the natural history and preventing progression of decompensated cirrhosis, as well as for trials aimed at managing the individual complications of cirrhosis.}

No clinical trials assessing FIT compared with no screening are planned, and few studies have assessed the population impact of such programmes.Before 2010, 11 out of 50 Spanish provinces initiated population-based organized screening programmes with FIT for an average-risk population aged 50–69 years. We used a quasi-experimental design across Spanish provinces between 1999 and 2016 to evaluate their impact on population age-standardized mortality and incidence rates due to CRC. Difference-in-differences and synthetic control analyses were performed to test for validation of statistical assumptions and to assess the dynamics of screening-associated changes in outcomes over time.No differences in outcome trends between exposed (n = 11) and control (n = 36) provinces were observed for up to 7 years preceding the implementation of screening. Relative to controls, exposed provinces experienced a mean increase in age-standardized incidence of 10.08\% [95\% confidence interval (CI) (5.09, 15.07)] 2 years after implementation, followed by a reduction in age-standardized mortality rates due to CRC of 8.82\% [95\% CI (3.77, 13.86)] after 7 years. Results were similar for both women and men. No associated changes were observed in adjacent age bands not targeted by screening, nor for 10 other major causes of death in the exposed provinces.FIT-based organized screening in Spain was associated with reductions in population colorectal cancer mortality.

   abstract = {Study Design. 

Retrospective review of prospectively-collected, multicenter adult spinal deformity (ASD) database.

Objective. 

The aim of this study was to evaluate the rate of patients who accrue catastrophic cost (CC) with ASD surgery utilizing direct, actual costs, and determine the feasibility of predicting these outliers.

Summary of Background Data. 

Cost outliers or surgeries resulting in CC are a major concern for ASD surgery as some question the sustainability of these surgical treatments.

Methods. 

Generalized linear regression models were used to explain the determinants of direct costs. Regression tree and random forest models were used to predict which patients would have CC (>$100,000).

Results. 

A total of 210 ASD patients were included (mean age of 59.3 years, 83% women). The mean index episode of care direct cost was $70,766 (SD = $24,422). By 90 days and 2 years following surgery, mean direct costs increased to $74,073 and $77,765, respectively. Within 90 days of the index surgery, 11 (5.2%) patients underwent 13 revisions procedures, and by 2 years, 26 (12.4%) patients had undergone 36 revision procedures. The CC threshold at the index surgery and 90-day and 2-year follow-up time points was exceeded by 11.9%, 14.8%, and 19.1% of patients, respectively. Top predictors of cost included number of levels fused, surgeon, surgical approach, interbody fusion (IBF), and length of hospital stay (LOS). At 90 days and 2 years, a total of 80.6% and 64.0% of variance in direct cost, respectively, was explained in the generalized linear regression models. Predictors of CC were number of fused levels, surgical approach, surgeon, IBF, and LOS.

Conclusion. 

The present study demonstrates that direct cost in ASD surgery can be accurately predicted. Collectively, these findings may not only prove useful for bundled care initiatives, but also may provide insight into means to reduce and better predict cost of ASD surgery outside of bundled payment plans.

abstract = {Background & Aims
Screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) is effective in the population at average risk. The most extended strategy in organized programs involves the fecal immunochemical test, which is limited by low sensitivity for the detection of advanced adenomas (AAs). We aimed to identify microRNA (miRNA) signatures in fecal samples that identify patients with AAs or CRC and might be used in noninvasive screening.
Methods
Our study comprised 4 stages. In the discovery phase, we performed genome-wide miRNA expression profiling of 124 fresh, paired colorectal tumor and nontumor samples (30 CRC; 32 AAs) from patients in Spain. In the technical validation stage, miRNAs with altered expression levels in tumor vs nontumor tissues were quantified by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction in fecal samples from a subset of patients included in the discovery phase (n = 39) and individuals without colorectal neoplasms (controls, n = 39). In the clinical validation stage, the miRNAs found to be most significantly up-regulated by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis were measured in an independent set of fecal samples (n = 767) from patients with positive results from fecal immunochemical tests in a CRC screening program. Finally, we developed a model to identify patients with advanced neoplasms (CRCs or AAs) based on their miRNA profiles, using findings from colonoscopy as the reference standard.
Results
Among 200 and 324 miRNAs significantly deregulated in CRC and AA tissues, respectively, 7 and 5 of these miRNAs were also found to be deregulated in feces (technical validation). Of them, MIR421, MIR130b-3p, and MIR27a-3p were confirmed to be upregulated in fecal samples from patients with advanced neoplasms. In our model, the combination of fecal level of MIR421, MIR27a-3p, and hemoglobin identified patients with CRC with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.93, compared with an AUC of 0.67 for fecal hemoglobin concentration alone.
Conclusions
We found that increased levels of 2 miRNAs and hemoglobin in feces can identify patients with AAs or CRC more accurately than fecal hemoglobin concentration alone. Assays for these miRNAs might be added to fecal tests for the detection of CRC or AAs.}

Sixteen articles (6,122 patients with MDR HAI and 8,326 patients with non-MDR HAI) were included in the systematic review of which 12 articles assessed cost, 19 articles length of stay, and 14 mortality. Compared to susceptible infections, MDR HAI were associated with increased cost (ROM 1.33, 95%CI [1.15; 1.54]), prolonged length of stay (ROM 1.27, 95%CI [1.18; 1.37]), and excess in-hospital mortality (RR 1.61, 95%CI [1.36; 1.90]) in the random effects models.

abstract = {Background & Aims
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and alcohol-related liver disease pose an important challenge to current clinical healthcare pathways because of the large number of at-risk patients. Therefore, we aimed to explore the cost-effectiveness of transient elastography (TE) as a screening method to detect liver fibrosis in a primary care pathway.
Methods
Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using real-life individual patient data from 6 independent prospective cohorts (5 from Europe and 1 from Asia). A diagnostic algorithm with conditional inference trees was developed to explore the relationships between liver stiffness, socio-demographics, comorbidities, and hepatic fibrosis, the latter assessed by fibrosis scores (FIB-4, NFS) and liver biopsies in a subset of 352 patients. We compared the incremental cost-effectiveness of a screening strategy against standard of care alongside the numbers needed to screen to diagnose a patient with fibrosis stage ≥F2.
Results
The data set encompassed 6,295 participants (mean age 55 ± 12 years, BMI 27 ± 5 kg/m2, liver stiffness 5.6 ± 5.0 kPa). A 9.1 kPa TE cut-off provided the best accuracy for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis (≥F2) in general population settings, whereas a threshold of 9.5 kPa was optimal for populations at-risk of alcohol-related liver disease. TE with the proposed cut-offs outperformed fibrosis scores in terms of accuracy. Screening with TE was cost-effective with mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranging from 2,570 €/QALY (95% CI 2,456–2,683) for a population at-risk of alcohol-related liver disease (age ≥45 years) to 6,217 €/QALY (95% CI 5,832–6,601) in the general population. Overall, there was a 12% chance of TE screening being cost saving across countries and populations.
Conclusions
Screening for liver fibrosis with TE in primary care is a cost-effective intervention for European and Asian populations and may even be cost saving.
Lay summary
The lack of optimized public health screening strategies for the detection of liver fibrosis in adults without known liver disease presents a major healthcare challenge. Analyses from 6 independent international cohorts, with transient elastography measurements, show that a community-based risk-stratification strategy for alcohol-related and non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases is cost-effective and potentially cost saving for our healthcare systems, as it leads to earlier identification of patients.}

Most studies suffer, however, from potential omitted variable bias, as they are based on simple comparisons of mothers who give birth vaginally and those who give birth by cesarean section. We try to overcome this limitation and provide credible causal evidence by using variation in the probability of having a c-section that is arguably unrelated to maternal and fetal characteristics: variation by time of day. Previous literature documents that, while nature distributes births and associated problems uniformly, time-dependent variables related to physicians’ demand for leisure are significant predictors of unplanned c-sections. Using a sample of public hospitals in Spain, we show that the rate of c-sections is higher during the early hours of the night compared to the rest of the day, while mothers giving birth at the different times are similar in observable characteristics. This exogenous variation provides us with a new instrument for type of birth: time of delivery. Our results suggest that non-medically indicated c-sections have a negative and significant impact on newborn health, as measured by Apgar scores, but that the effect is not severe enough to translate into more extreme outcomes.}
